# Tom Finley's Personal Site

This is the Github pages repository for my private site, meant to be rendered
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This is not meant to be publicly consumed
through Github itself, except perhaps as an example (whether or positive or
negative remains to be seen) of how to use Jekyll.

## Notes on Development

These are primarily notes for myself, since I tend to keep my sites for a while.
Greetings, future self! I hope you are still alive and well? In any case, just
as a reminder:

This uses a static site generator called Jekyll. I am using a dev container as
specified under `Dockerfile`, with VS Code as my primary editor. The means by
which I set this up was through [Bill Raymond's tutorial][br] on this subject.
(The tutorial is set up in such a way that it assumes that you are creating a
totally fresh GitHub Pages site, but it is relatively easy to adapt.)

Anyway, if you are starting from a fresh computer:

1. In VS Code, using the Dev Containers extension, then choosing the "Dev
   Containers: Open Folder in Container..." This will process the `Dockerfile`
   and set up the minimal environment. I have not published the image on an
   image repository, in the hopes that gem is semi-reliable.
2. Once that remote is set up, in the VS Code terminal we can use `bundle
   upgrade` and suchlike to make sure everything is properly loaded.
3. Using the script to serve/update a local configuration can be fine. This will
   serve it on (in container) `localhost` on port 4000, which the container is
   configured to expose.

The [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] have information on Jekyll itself, with GitHub
Pages specific information [here][gh-pages]. Questions can be posted
[here][jekyll-talk].

## Custom Behavior

The `postlist` layout type in Jekyll seems to be optimized for blog-style
content where recent content comes first. Adding a `chronology: true` to a
post-list page instead makes earlier matter comes first, which makes sense if a
reader would benefit from absorbing different posts in the order in which they
appear.

The `postlist` layout type can have its ordering over-ridden by having each post
have a `priority` value set in the post's YAML header. For instance, having
`priority: 10` in a post would make a post appear first above any posts with a
priority value less than `10` or where the `priority` is unspecified. In such an
instance the post list has a ðŸ“Œ in the top level description.
