title:  "Dwarf Fortress: Aquifer"

The past few days I've been "enjoying" [Dwarf Fortress][df-steam]. One of the
many mechanics the game has are [aquifers][df-wiki-squifer]. While there is a
significant amount of information on these structures, mostly the content is
geared towards how you overcome them as a problem. But, they have other uses as
well, in that they can be used as an infinite source of water even when surface
water is frozen.
