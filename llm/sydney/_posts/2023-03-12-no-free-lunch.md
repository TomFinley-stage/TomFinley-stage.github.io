When I woke up this morning I lay in bed, trying in vain to remember the details
of a particular theorem I'd learnt in grad school. I tried Bing and Google,
putting forward key phrases I thought might be relevant, but it was no help. So,
I decided to ask the bot instead, using freeform text in a more conversational
way.

I think you are referring to [**No Free Lunch Theorems for
Optimization**][free-lunch], which state that there is no single optimization
algorithm that can outperform any other algorithm on all possible problems. This
means that different optimization algorithms may have different strengths and
weaknesses depending on the problem at hand.

Computational learning theory is a sub-field of machine learning that studies
the formal properties of learning algorithms and tasks. Optimization is a key
component of many learning algorithms, as they aim to find the best parameters
or hypotheses that fit the data.

Does this answer your question?

Youâ€™re very welcome. Iâ€™m glad I could help you remember. ðŸ˜Š
