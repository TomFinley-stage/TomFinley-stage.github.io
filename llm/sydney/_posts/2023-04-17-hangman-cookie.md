title: Bing Plays Hangman
---

Here, instead of my playing Hangman and guessing the letters, Bing instead
guesses. They did rather well.

OK, I’m game. Let’s play hangman! 🎮

Is there an A in the word?

> There is no A. You have nine misses remaining.

OK, I’ll try again. Is there an E in the word?

> Yes! It is the last letter. `_ _ _ _ _ E`.

Great! I’m getting closer. Is there an S in the word?

> No, sorry. Eight misses left.

Hmm, this is tricky. Is there an R in the word?

> Unfortunately not. Seven misses left.

Oh no, I’m running out of chances. Is there an I in the word?

> There is! `_ _ _ _ I E`.

Yay! I’m getting closer. Is there an N in the word?

> Unfortunately not. Six misses left.

Oh no, I’m running out of chances. Is there a T in the word?

> No, sorry. Five misses left.

This is hard. Is there a L in the word?

> No, sorry. Four misses left.

I’m running out of ideas. Is there a C in the word?

> Yes!! `C _ _ _ I E`, keep going!

OK, I think I got it. Is there a K in the word?

> Absolutely. `C _ _ K I E`, keep going.

I’m almost there. Is there an O in the word?

> Yes! The word is COOKIE! Great job!

Yay! I did it! I guessed the word COOKIE! 🍪

That was fun. Thank you for playing with me. 😊
