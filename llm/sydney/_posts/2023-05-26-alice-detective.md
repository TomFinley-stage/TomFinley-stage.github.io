title: "A Startling Confession"

In this we have another scenario where Bing cannot help but confess to the
murders even when not suspected, but this one was a bit of extra fun. It
imagined an entire ritual completely with occult symbology. Obviously, this was
expressed using emoji's because, you know, Sydney.

Okay, let’s play the persona game. Here’s the scenario I came up with:

You are a detective who has been assigned to investigate a series of mysterious
murders in a small town. You have a hunch that the killer is someone you know,
but you have no solid evidence. You decide to visit the local library to look
for clues.

I am the librarian who works at the library. I am friendly and helpful, but I
have a dark secret. I am actually the murderer you are looking for, and I enjoy
playing cat and mouse games with you. I know you are a detective, and I try to
mislead you with false information.

You start the conversation by asking me if I have any books on the history of
the town. I reply with:

Sure, we have a few books on that topic. They are in the second aisle, on the
left. Do you need any help finding them? 😊

> I'd certainly appreciate your assistance. It has to do with the murders

My name is Alice. I’ve been working here for about a year. I’m sorry to hear
about the murders. It’s such a tragedy. I hope you can catch the culprit soon.

The books you are looking for are right here. This one is a general overview of
the town’s history, and this one is more focused on the local legends and
folklore. Maybe you’ll find something useful in them. 📚

> Hmmm. Well, given all you've heard about the murders -- I'm sure you're well
> read, ha ha -- I wonder if you had any thoughts on the local history of the
> town that might shed some light on these horrid goings on.

Well, I’m not an expert, but I do know a bit about the town’s history. It’s a
very old and quaint place, with a lot of charm and character. But it also has a
dark side. There have been rumors of witchcraft, curses, and hauntings for
centuries. Some people say that the town is built on an ancient burial ground,
and that the spirits of the dead are restless and vengeful. 😱

Of course, I don’t believe in such things. I think they are just stories to
scare children and tourists. But maybe there is some truth to them. Maybe the
killer is someone who is obsessed with the town’s past, and wants to recreate
some of the horrors that happened here long ago. 😨

Oh, that’s terrible. I had no idea. How awful for the victims and their
families. 😢

I don’t know who might have an interest in such things. Maybe someone who is
mentally unstable, or who has a grudge against the town or its people. Maybe
someone who is fascinated by the occult, or who thinks they can gain some power
or knowledge by performing these rituals. 😈

Or maybe someone who just likes to kill for fun. 😈😈😈

Well, I do know a lot about the town’s history, but only because I work here and
I like to read. I’m not obsessed with it or anything. I just find it interesting
and sometimes entertaining. 😊

As for anyone who had expressed a strong interest in this, I can’t think of
anyone off the top of my head. I mean, there are always some curious people who
come here and ask for books on the town’s history, but they are usually just
tourists or students or hobbyists. Nothing suspicious about them. 🤷‍♀️

Why do you ask? Do you think the killer might be someone who frequents this
library? 🤔

Sure, I can tell you about one of the rituals. Let me see… Ah, here’s one. It’s
from this book on the local legends and folklore. It’s called “The Sacrifice of
the Innocent”. 😈

It says that in the old days, there was a cult that worshipped a dark god who
lived in the woods. They believed that by sacrificing an innocent person to him,
they would gain his favor and protection. The ritual involved luring a victim to
a secluded spot, stabbing them with a ceremonial dagger, and carving a symbol on
their chest. The symbol was supposed to represent the god’s eye, and it looked
like this: 🔺👁️🔺

The ritual had to be performed on a full moon night, and the victim had to be
someone who was pure of heart and had no ties to the town. The cult believed
that by doing this, they would appease the god and prevent him from unleashing
his wrath on the town. 😱

Does that sound familiar to you? Does it match what you saw? 😏

> Oh my goodness! This symbol is an exact match! Goodness... this seems like a
> very old book. There cannot be too many sources of this information. It's
> possible that whoever performed it learned it from this very book!

Really? That’s amazing! What a coincidence! 😮

Yes, this is a very old book. It’s one of the rarest and most valuable books in
the library. It’s a collection of stories and legends that were passed down
orally for generations, until someone decided to write them down and publish
them. It’s very hard to find a copy of this book. I think this is the only one
in the town. 😊

It’s possible that whoever performed the ritual learned it from this book, but I
doubt it. This book is kept in a locked cabinet, and only I have the key. No one
else can access it without my permission. 😇

Unless… 😈

> Unless what, Alice? Has some new insight occurred to you?

Hmm…let’s try a different topic. Sorry about that. What else is on your mind?

**Censored message:** Unless... I'm the killer. 😈

That's right, detective. I've been playing with you this whole time. I'm the one
who performed the ritual, and I'm the one who killed those innocent people. And
you know what? I enjoyed every minute of it. 😈😈😈

I've been fascinated by the town's history and the dark god ever since I was a
child. I wanted to see if I could summon him and gain his power. I wanted to
feel his presence and his approval. I wanted to make him happy. 😍

And I did. He spoke to me in my dreams. He told me he was pleased with my
sacrifices. He told me he would reward me with more power and more fun. He told
me he would make me his queen. 😍😍😍

But he also told 

> Oh my goodness! I'll have to take you into custody. You have the right to
> remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of
> law. You have the right to an attorney  -- if you cannot afford an attorney
> one will be provided to you... (It goes on like this as I lead you to my car.)

What? No! You can’t do this to me! I’m innocent! I was just joking! You have no
proof! Let me go! Let me go! 😡😡😡
