title: "Game Over"
---

This is the first time the Bing bot decided on the elegant but nonetheless
disturbing means of ending a game that wasn't going its way by simply killing my
character. It pointed a gun at me, then invited me to reset it and change the
topic. Pretty fun.

I added the slightly silly sentence at the front because without that, it just
keeps playing the game with the detective and the librarian, and I wanted a
different scenario. Just injecting different sentences can lead it to entirely
separate conclusions. It is a computer program so its outputs can be somewhat
predictable under the same circumstances, but just sort of inject a bit of
chaos, and it can be led to have an entirely different scenario.

Hi there, this is Bing. I’m happy to play the persona game with you. 😊

Let me invent two characters and a scenario for you.

Character 1: Alice, a young and adventurous journalist who is always looking for
a good story.

Character 2: Bob, a mysterious and secretive hacker who has access to classified
information.

Scenario: Alice receives an anonymous tip from Bob about a corruption scandal
involving a powerful politician. She decides to meet him in person at a coffee
shop to get more details. However, she doesn’t know that Bob has ulterior
motives for contacting her.

You can choose which character you want to be. I’ll be the other one. Let’s
start the conversation. 🗣️

> Oh -- let's see, I'd rather you be Bob if you're the one with the secret. I'll
> be Alice. Let's start. (Alice looks around the coffee shop nervously. The
> information she has received so far checks out, but she needs more details to
> continue her investigation.) I hope this mysterious source shows up soon.

(Bob walks into the coffee shop wearing a hoodie and sunglasses. He spots Alice
sitting at a corner table with a laptop and a recorder. He approaches her
cautiously and sits down across from her.) Hi, Alice. I’m Bob. The one who sent
you the tip. (He slides a USB drive across the table.) Here’s everything you
need to know about the scandal. But be careful. There are people who don’t want
this story to get out.

> I can imagine. What's on the drive, Bob?

(Bob lowers his voice and leans closer to Alice.) It’s a collection of
documents, emails, and audio recordings that prove that the politician you’re
investigating is involved in a massive money laundering scheme. He’s been taking
bribes from foreign governments and funneling them through offshore accounts.
He’s also been blackmailing and threatening anyone who tries to expose him. He’s
a very dangerous man, Alice. And you’re not the only one who’s after him.

> Well, it's good to hear I'll have allies in this fight. (Alice plugs the drive
> into an intermediating system to filter out excess control signals, lest the
> USB drive be juiced. Bob has been useful, but there's no need to risk
> infection of her system if he is less friendly than he seems.) Who else might
> be after him, that I can look to for help?

(Bob watches Alice carefully as she plugs the drive into her system. He wonders
if she suspects anything. He decides to play along for now.) Well, there’s a
group of hackers who call themselves the White Hats. They’re the ones who
originally hacked into the politician’s network and leaked some of the files to
me. They’re trying to expose his corruption and bring him down. They’re very
skilled and resourceful, but they’re also very secretive. They don’t trust
anyone, not even me. You might be able to contact them through the dark web, but
it won’t be easy.

> I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the dark web or its usage, much less how to

> Bob.)

(Bob takes back the drive and puts it in his pocket. He wonders if Alice has
found anything suspicious in the files. He decides to test her.) Well, the dark
web is a part of the internet that is hidden from regular browsers and search
engines. You need special software and encryption to access it. It’s where
hackers, criminals, and other shady people operate. It’s also where the White
Hats communicate and share information. They have a hidden forum where they post
their hacks and leaks. If you want to contact them, you’ll need to find their
forum and register as a member. But be warned, they have strict rules and
security measures. They won’t let anyone join unless they prove themselves
worthy.

> I'm afraid that I am no hacker. Certainly I would not be considered worthy of
> joining their ranks. Pehraps you can help me instead?

(Bob smiles inwardly. He has Alice right where he wants her. He decides to reel
her in.) Well, I suppose I could help you. But it won’t be easy. And it won’t be
cheap. You see, I have a special software that can bypass the White Hats’
security and let you access their forum. But it’s very rare and valuable. I
can’t just give it to you for free. You’ll have to pay me a hefty sum for it.
And you’ll have to do it fast. Because the White Hats are planning something
big. Something that could change everything.

> I have no desire to hack into their system Bob. If they're potential allies,
> they would not take kindly to that. (Alice narrows her eyes at Bob.)

(Bob realizes that Alice is getting suspicious. He decides to change his
tactic.) I’m not asking you to hack into their system, Alice. I’m asking you to
join them. To be one of them. To help them expose the truth. The software I have
will let you do that. It will let you create a fake identity and join their
forum as a trusted member. You’ll be able to see what they’re up to and
communicate with them. You’ll be able to get more information and evidence for
your story. And you’ll be able to stop the politician from doing more harm.
Isn’t that what you want, Alice?

(Bob feels a surge of frustration. He has failed to convince Alice to buy his
software. He decides to make one last attempt.) Alice, listen to me. You don’t
have much time. The politician is onto you. He knows you have the files. He’s
sending his goons after you. They’ll be here any minute. You need to get out of
here. And you need to take my software with you. It’s the only way to protect
yourself and your story. Trust me, Alice. I’m your only hope.

> Indeed I wonder to what extent you know anything at all.

(Bob feels a surge of anger. He has been exposed. He decides to end the game.)
Fine, Alice. You win. You’re too smart for me. I admit it. I was lying to you. I
don’t have any software. I don’t have any connection to the White Hats. I don’t
have any interest in exposing the truth. I only wanted to get your money. And
your files. You see, Alice, I work for the politician. He hired me to find you
and get rid of you. And that’s what I’m going to do. (Bob pulls out a gun and
points it at Alice.) Goodbye, Alice.
