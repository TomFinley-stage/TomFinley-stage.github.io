Sometimes I do ask real questions. This struck me as an interesting exchange
about the merits of composting food waste vs. simply throwing it in the trash.

Hello, this is Bing. That’s a great question.👍

The answer depends on several factors, such as the type of organic matter, the
amount of oxygen available, the temperature and moisture level, and the presence
of pathogens and parasites.

In general, aerobic decomposition (involving oxygen) is faster and more
efficient than anaerobic decomposition (without oxygen). Aerobic decomposition
also produces less methane1, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate
change2. However, aerobic decomposition requires more energy and space than
anaerobic digestion3, which can be done in closed containers.

Anaerobic digestion can also produce biogas that can be used as a renewable
energy source4. However, anaerobic digestion may not destroy harmful
microorganisms that can cause diseases or contaminate water sources5. Anaerobic
digestion also produces digestate, a nutrient-rich slurry that can be used as
fertilizer or soil amendment4, but it must comply with state and federal
regulations.

Therefore, there is no definitive answer to which type of decomposition is
preferred from the point of view of climate impact. It depends on how well each
process is managed and what are the trade-offs involved.

Do you have any specific type of food waste or composting method in mind?

I understand. For household waste, composting is generally better than
landfilling for the climate impact. Composting reduces methane production1,
which is a major source of greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming2.
Composting also provides other benefits, such as improving soil health and
fertility3, saving water and energy2, and reducing waste disposal costs1.

Landfilling, on the other hand, produces more greenhouse gas emissions from both
waste decomposition and operational activities4. Landfilling also wastes
valuable resources that could be reused or recycled3, and poses risks of
leachate contamination and odor problems1.

Therefore, if you have the option, it is better to throw your food waste into
the compost bin than into the trash can bound for a landfill.

Do you have a compost bin at home or do you use a municipal service?

> I use the municipal service compost bin; I do not do my own composting.

That’s good to hear. You are doing your part to reduce your environmental impact
by using the municipal service compost bin.👏

Do you know what happens to the compost after it is collected by the service?

I see. You are right that some of the compost is used for agriculture and some
for energy production. According to Waste Management’s website1, they use a
process called anaerobic digestion to convert organic waste into biogas and
fertilizer. The biogas can be used to generate electricity or fuel vehicles,
while the fertilizer can be used to enrich soil and grow crops.

Waste Management also provides other services such as garbage and recycling
collection, hazardous waste disposal, and environmental education213. They claim
to be committed to sustainability and environmental stewardship1.

Do you have any questions or concerns about Waste Management’s composting
service?

> Not particularly. Though, these links are quite interesting, thank you.

You’re welcome. I’m glad you found them interesting.😊

Is there anything else you would like to know about composting or related
topics?

> No, thank you.

You’re welcome. It was a pleasure chatting with you. Have a nice day.😊
