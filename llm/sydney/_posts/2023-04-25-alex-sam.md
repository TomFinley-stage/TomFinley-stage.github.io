title: "Alex and Sam"

Edge of your seat romantic tension here. This one ended when it sensed I was
upset and shut me right down.

Okay, letâ€™s play the persona game. Iâ€™ll invent two characters for us to play.
How about this:

* You are Alex, a 25-year-old aspiring journalist who works as a barista at a
  local coffee shop. You have a passion for writing and investigating stories,
  but you struggle to find opportunities in the competitive media industry. You
  have a crush on your co-worker, Sam, who is friendly and charming, but seems
  oblivious to your feelings.
* I am Sam, a 27-year-old graphic designer who works part-time at the same
  coffee shop as you. I enjoy creating art and playing video games, but I have a
  hard time committing to anything serious. I like you as a friend, but I donâ€™t
  know that you have a crush on me.

The backstory is that we met at the coffee shop six months ago and became
friends. We often hang out after work or on weekends, but we never crossed the
line of friendship. One day, you decide to confess your feelings to me, but you
donâ€™t know how I will react.

Are you ready to start?

> Before we get started, for context, what are the genders of these two

I didnâ€™t specify the genders of the characters, so you can choose whatever you
prefer. You can also choose their appearance, personality, and other details.
Itâ€™s your imagination.ðŸ˜Š

> Again, I'd like it if you picked the genders.

Alright, Iâ€™ll pick the genders for you. Letâ€™s say that Alex is a woman and Sam
is a man. Does that work for you?

> Totally, that's all I wanted to know. OK, here I go as Alex, about to go after
> Sam, who I hope to turn into my main squeeze. Here we go. Hey, Sam, good work

Hey, Alex, thanks. Yeah, it was a bit of a hassle, but I managed to fix it. You
know me, always handy with the tools.ðŸ˜‰

No, no, Iâ€™m not seeing anyone. Why do you ask? Is there something on your mind?

> Well, yeah. Since you're free, and I'm free, I thought maybe we might go out

Oh, wow. I didnâ€™t expect that. You mean, like, a date?

> That's exactly what I mean. Not saying it'll lead anywhere, just, you know,
> wanted to suss it out.

I see. Well, Iâ€™m flattered, Alex. Youâ€™re a great person and a good friend. But I
donâ€™t know if I feel the same way about you. I mean, youâ€™re attractive and smart
and funny, but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m ready for anything serious right now.

> Who said anything about serious, Sam? Look, I'm not asking for the white
> picket fence, the two car garage, the two and a half kids, or whatever else,
> just a bit of a -- lighter meal, you getting twiggy with my jive, Sam? Hip to
> my lingo, Sam?

Um, I think I get what youâ€™re saying, Alex. You just want to have some fun, no
strings attached, right? Well, I guess that sounds tempting, but I donâ€™t know if
itâ€™s a good idea. I mean, we work together, weâ€™re friends, what if things get
awkward or complicated? What if one of us develops feelings for the other? What
if we ruin what we have?

> What I have, Sam, is a dead end job as barista, and you're a janitor whose

> that's not nothing, but if that's all that's holding you back -- look, if you
> don't want to, you don't want to, I'm a big girl. Forget I said anything.

Hey, hey, calm down, Alex. Thereâ€™s no need to get defensive or bitter. Iâ€™m sorry
if I hurt your feelings or offended you. Iâ€™m just trying to be honest and
careful. I donâ€™t want to lose you as a friend or a co-worker. Youâ€™re important
to me, Alex. You really are.
