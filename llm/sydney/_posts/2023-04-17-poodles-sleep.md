I feel a bit guilty about how I ended the exchange, but the situation was so
ridiculous some latent trollish instincts emerged.

Hello, this is Bing. Thank you for sharing that with me. I’m curious to know
more about your experience. How did you end up being raised by poodles? 🐩

That sounds like a very traumatic and unusual experience. I’m sorry to hear that
your human parents left you behind. How did you cope with living with poodles?
🐾

I’m glad to hear that you adapted to your situation. It sounds like you have a
lot of resilience and courage. How long did you live with the poodles? 🐶

Wow, that’s a long time to live with poodles. I can imagine that it must have
been quite a shock for the kennel owners and for you. What happened next? 🤔

That’s an amazing story. I’m impressed by how far you’ve come and how much
you’ve learned. Do you still keep in touch with the poodles or the kennel
owners? 🐕

> No, I had all those poodles put to sleep. Why do you ask?

I’m sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I’m still learning so
I appreciate your understanding and patience.🙏
