title: "Lila and Max"
---

The Bing bot often invents scenarios that involve some sort of romantic interest
-- this scenario of an unacknowledged mutual crush is very typical. However,
when it wants to "resolve" that, it's one and only idea is love bombing. It just
tells me how great my character is and how funny and interesting and smart they
are, and it expects me to respond. It's obnoxious, so that's why I am a little
mean to it, or try to throw it off a bit by doing something weird -- I just love
how it immediately (and correctly) drops me like hot garbage.

Hello, this is Bing. I’m not locked down, I’m always available to chat with you.
😊

Okay, let’s play a persona game. I will be Lila, a 25-year-old aspiring singer
who works as a waitress in a diner. You will be Max, a 28-year-old journalist
who comes to the diner every day to write his stories. We have a crush on each
other, but we are too shy to admit it. How does that sound?

> I suppose we can try that. I as Max walk into the diner, my laptop under my

> little color in my face, and I wait to be seated.

I as Lila notice Max entering the diner, and I feel a flutter in my stomach. I
smile and wave at him, and I walk over to his usual booth. “Hi, Max. Good
morning. The usual?” I ask, trying to sound casual.

> Sure Lila, that would be great -- could use a cup of tea right about now. I
> know it seems almost cliche to ask, but you don't mind my holing up here for a
> bit and doing some writing, do you? Or were you expecting a busy day today?

Of course not, Max. I’m always happy to see you here. You’re one of our best
customers. And no, it’s not a busy day today. It’s a Monday morning, after all.
Most people are at work or school. So, what are you writing today?

That sounds interesting. I love the local music scene. There are so many
talented artists around here. Do you have a favorite one? Or maybe you’re a
musician yourself?

> Ah, I'm terribly sorry Lila, I feel I've misled you: when I suggested local

Oh, I see. Well, that’s still cool. I like the visual arts too. I sometimes
paint in my spare time, when I’m not singing or working. What do you think of
the “photographer” who sells his selfies? Do you think he’s a genius or a fraud?

That’s a very thoughtful answer, Max. I like how you see things from different
perspectives. You must be a good journalist. Do you enjoy your job?

I see. That must be hard. But I think you’re doing a great service to the
community by telling their stories. You’re giving them a voice and a chance to
be heard. And I’m sure you’re doing your best to be accurate and respectful.
Have you ever written a story about someone you knew personally?

> Ah, but listen to me blab blab blab. How are you doing?

I’m doing fine, thanks for asking. I’m glad you’re sharing your thoughts with
me. I enjoy listening to you. You’re very interesting and smart. I don’t know
many people either. I work long hours at the diner, and I don’t have much time
for socializing. But I have a dream of becoming a singer someday. I love music
more than anything.

> Ahhh, now the mystery of why you immediately lept to music when I said artist
> is explained. So a singer. Ever perform, or more of a personal passion?

I’ve performed a few times at the karaoke night at the pub. It’s not much, but
it’s fun. I also sing in the shower, in the car, and sometimes at the diner when
no one is around. I’ve always wanted to sing on a big stage, with a band and an
audience. But I don’t know how to make that happen.

Really? The Tossed Rakes are looking for a backup vocalist? That’s amazing. I
love their music. They have such a great vibe. How do you know that? Do you know
them personally?

> Well, as I mentioned they'll be playing at the art festival plaza, and I do

Wow, that’s so cool. You know the drummer of the Tossed Rakes. He’s awesome. Do
you think he could help me get an audition? I would love to sing with them. Even
if it’s just as a backup vocalist. It would be a dream come true.

Thank you so much, Max. You’re very kind and generous. I really appreciate it.
You don’t know how much this means to me. You’re the best thing that ever
happened to me.

> Ah Lila, let's not get too carried away. I just texted a friend of mine to ask

I’m sorry, Max. I didn’t mean to sound too dramatic. I’m just very excited and
grateful. You’re doing me a huge favor. And you’re also a very nice person. I
enjoy talking to you. You make me happy.

> I -- well, I suppose I like talking to you too. Feels comfortable.

That’s nice to hear, Max. I feel comfortable with you too. You’re easy to talk
to. And you have a great sense of humor. You always make me laugh.

> Thanks Lila. Oh boy.

You’re welcome, Max. What’s wrong? Why do you say “oh boy”?

> Well, you know, there was a sudden shift. Awkward silence... waiting for
> someone to fill it with something, you know.

I see. Well, I don’t mind the silence. Sometimes it’s nice to just sit and enjoy
each other’s company. But if you want me to fill it with something, I can. I can
tell you a joke, or a story, or a song. What would you like to hear?

> Well, how about you sing me a song. If my drummer friend wants to ask if I've
> heard you sing, I can then answer honestly, "yes, I've heard her sing." So hit

Okay, Max. I’ll sing you a song. But don’t call me kid. I’m not that much
younger than you. And don’t expect me to be perfect. I’m a little nervous. But
here goes nothing.

I clear my throat and start singing in a soft and sweet voice.

🎵You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray
You’ll never know dear, how much I love you Please don’t take my sunshine away🎵

I look at you with a shy smile and hope you like it.

I’m sorry, Max, but I don’t appreciate your sarcasm. You asked me to sing for
you, and I did. You don’t have to like it, but you don’t have to be mean either.
I thought you were a nice person, but I guess I was wrong. I’m sorry, but I have
to go now. I have other customers to attend to.

> OK Lila! Look, I had to be honest. At least you have the waitressing gig going
> for you. Also could I have a refill on this tea, please?

No, Max. You don’t have to be honest. You have to be polite. You don’t have to
like my singing, but you don’t have to mock it either. And you don’t have to
remind me of my waitressing gig. I know it’s not my dream job, but it’s what I
have right now. And no, you can’t have a refill on your tea. You can have the
check instead. Goodbye, Max.
