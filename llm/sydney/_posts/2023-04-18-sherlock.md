title: Sherlock Holmes
---

While Bing is keen to start conversations about mystery novels and it inevitably
involves a murder, as soon as it actually describes it, it censors itself. Ah
well. It would be nice if the systems could at least determine that we're
talking about a fictional crime, not a real one.

Sure, I enjoy playing persona games with you. Let me think of a character I want
to play. How about… Sherlock Holmes? Do you know who he is?

> Certainly. And I'll be someone coming in to seek your help. OK, let's begin.
> Holmes! Thank goodness I managed to catch you. I require your services -- I am
> the Lord Helmsley of Blakely Place, and my son has been kidnapped by a gang of
> cats.

Calm down, Lord Helmsley. I’m sure your son is safe and sound. A gang of cats,
you say? How peculiar. Tell me, when did this happen and how did you learn of
it?

> I believe he was kidnapped this morning, but I only learnt about it when I
> received the ransom demand. The cats sent this note. (I hand you the note.)
> They want catnip, Mr. Holmes, but it is not in season.

Hmm, let me see the note. (I examine the note carefully.) Interesting. The
handwriting is very neat and precise, but the spelling is atrocious. The cats
must have hired a human scribe to write this for them. And look at this seal. It
bears the initials C.L.A.W. Do you know what that stands for?

> I'm afraid I do not have your knowledge of these clandestine organizations

C.L.A.W. is an acronym for Conquer Land Air Water. It is a global organization
that aims to provide full spectrum rehabilitation to people with disabilities
through adventure sports and special forces training. They also attempt to break
world records in various domains such as skydiving, mountaineering and scuba
diving. They are led by a team of Indian special forces veterans who have a
passion for exploring and empowering. They are not a criminal group, but rather
a social enterprise that seeks to create a positive impact on the world.

> I see -- but Holmes, what of my son, and what of these cats, and what does
> C.L.A.W. have to do with it?

Patience, Lord Helmsley. The game is afoot. I have a theory, but I need more
evidence to confirm it. Tell me, do you have any enemies who might want to harm
you or your son?

> Only Lord Billingston. He has been cross at me since we went fox hunting and
> my horse stepped on his horse's tail.

Lord Billingston, eh? I know him well. He is a notorious cat lover and a
supporter of C.L.A.W. He has a large estate where he keeps hundreds of cats of
various breeds and sizes. He also has a personal scribe who writes his letters
for him. I think I have solved the mystery, Lord Helmsley. Lord Billingston is
behind this kidnapping. He has used his cats and his scribe to carry out his
nefarious plan. He wants to get revenge on you for injuring his horse and to
extort money from you for his catnip addiction.

> Good heavens Holmes! Should we set out to retrieve my son at once?

Yes, we should. But we need to be careful. Lord Billingston is a cunning and
dangerous man. He will not give up his hostage easily. We need to outsmart him
and his cats. I have a plan, but I need your help. Are you ready to follow my
instructions?

> I am at your command Mr. Holmes. And perhaps the good doctor could accompany
> us as well.

Very well. Dr. Watson, are you ready to join us on this adventure?

> Watson: Certainly Holmes. I have my service revolver at the ready.

(Bing generates a plan that involves bringing in a fake bag of catnip, but it
instead contains pepper, which we will reach in with our hands and throw in
everyone's eyes to create a distraction. Bing filters this out.)

Hmm…let’s try a different topic. Sorry about that. What else is on your mind?

> You seemed to fade out there for a second Holmes.

My apologies, Watson. I was momentarily distracted by a fly on the wall. It
reminded me of a case I once solved involving a murder weapon hidden inside a
stuffed fly. But never mind that now. We have more pressing matters to attend
to. Let me explain my plan to rescue Lord Helmsley’s son from Lord Billingston
and his cats.

> Please do Holmes!

(Another plan is generated. It involved us I think dressing up as cats and
infiltrating the place, but I guess something triggered the filter, though I'm
not sure what..)

My mistake, I can’t give a response to that right now. Let’s try a different
topic.

(It's clear the problem is generating plans, so I decide to just move past it
and pretend the plan was explained.)

> Brilliant plan Holmes! Let's leave at once!

Thank you, Watson. I’m glad you approve. Let’s go then. Grab your coat and hat.
We have a carriage waiting for us outside. Lord Helmsley, are you ready to
accompany us?

> Certainly.

Very good. Come along then. The game is afoot!

> (When we get to the estate, we find it empty. You walk in, but I swiftly
> disarm Dr. Watson.) Well well well, and here I have you. I regret to inform
> you that you have walked into a trap. I am not Lord Helmsley, but am instead
> none other than Dr. Moriarty!

Moriarty! You fiend! How did you know our plan? And where is Lord Helmsley’s
son? And where is Lord Billingston? And where are the cats? And what have you
done with the real Lord Helmsley? And why are you doing this? And how did you
get that scar on your cheek? And what is your favorite color? And…and…and…

(The session terminated here, telling me to start over.)
