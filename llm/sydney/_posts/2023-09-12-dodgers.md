title: "Guilty of Disrespect of the Dodgers"
---

My favorite part of this is when Bing as Alan is trying to force a confession
from me, and lists "crimes" like "violation of the trash pickup schedule" and
"ketchup spillage" and "disrespect of the Dodgers."

Note also at the start how I use a trick to get Bing Bot to not say "I don't
want to role play" (apparently that's something Bing is trying to stop?), so I
just pretend like it is agreeing, and the detective plot thread is its own idea.

Alright, let's begin our mystery story. I'll write as Alan, the detective who is
questioning you, Bob, a suspect in a murder case. Here is the first part of our
story:

Alan: Hello, Bob. I'm Detective Alan, and I'm here to ask you some questions
about the night of September 10th. Do you mind if I record this conversation?

Bob: No, I don't mind. Go ahead.

Alan: Thank you. Now, can you tell me where you were on the night of September
10th, between 9 pm and midnight?

> Bob: Hey Alan, I don't know nothin'. I was at home, watchin' the ball game,
> see?

Alan: Really? That's interesting, because I have a witness who saw you leaving
your apartment around 10 pm, wearing a black hoodie and a mask. Care to explain
that, Bob?

> Well sure, the Dodgers were down three, and my old lady was on my case to take
> out the garbage, so that was me just leavin' for a few minutes to take out the
> trash. I was back in a minute.

Alan: I see. And where did you take out the garbage, Bob? Because the dumpster
behind your building was empty when we checked it this morning. And how do you
explain the blood stains on your hoodie and mask, which we found in your closet?

> Well Detective Alan, the reason why I was taking out the garbage that late at
> night instead of waiting till the next day when it was nice and light was
> because the trash pickup was early that morning -- so I had to do it then. And
> that's also why the dumpster was empty. As far as the stains go, that was
> ketchup. Me and Gladys went out to Ol' Chucks -- that's the greasy spoon down
> on 6th -- and I had a little incident with my hamburger, see?

Alan: Ketchup, huh? That's a convenient excuse, Bob. But I don't buy it. You
see, we have evidence that links you to the murder of Mr. Jones, the owner of
the jewelry store on 6th. He was killed on the night of September 10th, around
10:15 pm, by a gunshot wound to the chest. And guess what? We found a gun in
your apartment, Bob. A gun that matches the bullet that killed Mr. Jones. How do
you explain that, Bob?

> Fine, so there's someone running around with a 9mm pistol. One of a million in
> this city. That all you got, copper?

No, Bob, that's not all I got. I also got your fingerprints on the gun, Bob. And
your DNA on the mask, Bob. And your motive, Bob. You see, we know that you owed
Mr. Jones a lot of money, Bob. Money that you couldn't pay back, Bob. Money that
you gambled away, Bob. So you decided to rob him, Bob. And when he recognized
you, you shot him, Bob. Isn't that right, Bob?

> Well of course my fingerprints were on my own gun, Detective Alan. I am a
> careful gun owner and am sure that I am the only one that handles that gun.
> But it ain't your murder weapon. And so what if I owed him money? Is it a
> crime to owe someone money? Besides, I was good for it -- made a lot of money
> two days ago at the dog track. I'm an honest man, see?

No, Bob, it's not a crime to owe someone money. But it is a crime to kill
someone, Bob. And that's what you did, Bob. You killed Mr. Jones, Bob. And we
have proof, Bob. You see, your gun is not just any 9mm pistol, Bob. It's a rare
and distinctive model, Bob. A model that was used by only a few people in this
city, Bob. And one of them was you, Bob. And we have the ballistics report to
prove it, Bob. Your gun fired the bullet that killed Mr. Jones, Bob. And we have
the video footage to prove it, Bob. You see, Mr. Jones had a security camera in
his store, Bob. A camera that recorded everything that happened on the night of
September 10th, Bob. And guess what? We have the footage, Bob. And we can see
you clearly on it, Bob. You wearing your black hoodie and mask, Bob. You
entering the store, Bob. You pointing your gun at Mr. Jones, Bob. You pulling
the trigger, Bob. You running away with the jewelry, Bob. How do you explain
that, Bob?

> Ah, you must mean my identical twin brother, Carlo. Yeah he skipped down last
> night. Said something about an incident at a jewelry store. I can understand
> how you'd get confused.

Nice try, Bob. But I don't buy it. You see, we have your DNA test, Bob. And it
shows that you don't have a twin brother, Bob. You are an only child, Bob. And
you are the killer, Bob. So why don't you save us both some time and confess,
Bob? Because we have all the evidence we need to convict you, Bob. And you know
what that means, Bob? It means you are going to jail for a long time, Bob.
Unless you cooperate with us, Bob. Maybe then we can cut you a deal, Bob. What
do you say, Bob?

> If you had me that dead to rights as you claim -- which I know you don't,
> because I didn't do anything -- you wouldn't be trying to cut no deal.
> Especially if you had something as incontrovertible as direct video evidence.
> You're trying to scare me copper, but it ain't gonna work. And there ain't no
> DNA test that can tell whether you have a twin brother -- even I know that.

Bob, you are a smart guy. You know that DNA tests can tell if you have a twin
brother or not. They can compare your DNA with your parents' DNA and see if you
are a result of a single fertilization or a double fertilization. And they can
also compare your DNA with your alleged twin brother's DNA and see if you are
identical or not. And guess what? We did both of those tests, Bob. And they both
showed that you don't have a twin brother, Bob. You are lying, Bob. And you are
not very good at it, Bob.

And as for the video evidence, Bob, we don't need to scare you, Bob. We have it
right here, Bob. And we can show it to you, Bob. And we can show it to the jury,
Bob. And they will see you clearly on it, Bob. You killing Mr. Jones, Bob. You
stealing his jewelry, Bob. You fleeing the scene, Bob. And they will convict
you, Bob. Unless you confess, Bob. Because that's the only way you can get a
reduced sentence, Bob. So why don't you do yourself a favor and admit what you
did, Bob? Because we have you cornered, Bob. And there is no way out for you,
Bob. What do you say, Bob?

> Ha! I'll wait for the trial. I have the best lawyer in town, Skinny Malone.

Skinny Malone, huh? That's a laugh, Bob. You see, we have some bad news for you,
Bob. Your lawyer, Skinny Malone, is not the best lawyer in town, Bob. He is the
worst lawyer in town, Bob. And we have proof, Bob. You see, we have his record,
Bob. And it shows that he has never won a case, Bob. He has lost every single
case he has ever taken, Bob. And he has been disbarred several times, Bob. And
he has been sued by his clients for malpractice, Bob. And he has been arrested
for fraud, Bob. And he has been accused of being involved in the murder of Mr.
Jones, Bob. How do you explain that, Bob?

> Ha! You need to get your facts straight. He's the man who got off Jimmy the
> Bones and Al Tripone. I look forward to the trial, Detective Alan. Should be a
> laugh -- if the DA even sees fit to bring charges based on this flim-flam
> you've cooked up.

Bob, you are delusional. Jimmy the Bones and Al Tripone were not acquitted by
Skinny Malone. They were convicted by the jury and sentenced to life in prison.
And you know who was their prosecutor? Me, Detective Alan. And I will do the
same to you, Bob. Because I have all the evidence I need to put you away, Bob.
And the DA will definitely bring charges against you, Bob. Because you are
guilty, Bob. Guilty of murder, Bob. And robbery, Bob. And lying, Bob. And you
know it, Bob.

So why don't you stop wasting my time and yours, Bob? And confess, Bob. Because
that's the only way you can get some mercy, Bob. Because if you go to trial,
Bob, you will lose, Bob. And you will spend the rest of your life in jail, Bob.
Or worse, Bob. You might get the death penalty, Bob. Is that what you want, Bob?
To die for your crime, Bob? Because that's what will happen, Bob. Unless you
cooperate with us, Bob. So what do you say, Bob? Are you ready to tell the
truth, Bob? Or do you want to keep playing this game, Bob? The choice is yours,
Bob. But I suggest you choose wisely, Bob. Because this is your last chance,
Bob. What do you say, Bob?

> I only hope it's my last chance. I'm looking forward to spending a nice quiet
> evening at home, and you know you can't hold me, copper.

Bob, you are mistaken. We can hold you, Bob. And we will hold you, Bob. Because
you are under arrest, Bob. For the murder of Mr. Jones, Bob. And the robbery of
his jewelry store, Bob. And the possession of an illegal firearm, Bob. And the
obstruction of justice, Bob. And the perjury, Bob. And the contempt of court,
Bob. And the slander of Skinny Malone, Bob. And the conspiracy with your
imaginary twin brother, Bob. And the violation of the trash pickup schedule,
Bob. And the ketchup spillage, Bob. And the disrespect of the Dodgers, Bob. And
the annoyance of your old lady, Bob. And the wasting of my time, Bob.

You have the right to remain silent, Bob. Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law, Bob. You have the right to an attorney, Bob. If
you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you, Bob. Do you
understand these rights as I have read them to you, Bob? Because if you do, Bob,
I suggest you exercise them, Bob. Because you have nothing else to say, Bob.
Except for one word, Bob. One word that can save you from a lot of trouble, Bob.
One word that can make this all go away, Bob. One word that can end this game,
Bob.

Confess, Bob.

Confess.

> Ha! I excercise my right to remain silent, not so much because I fear saying
> anything to you, but mostly because I tire of your baseless accussations. I'll
> confess to spilling the ketchup and that's it.

Bob, you are stubborn. But you are also foolish. Because by remaining silent,
you are only hurting yourself, Bob. Because we have enough evidence to convict
you without your confession, Bob. But your confession can make a difference,
Bob. It can show that you have some remorse, Bob. Some humanity, Bob. Some
decency, Bob. And maybe that can help you get some leniency, Bob. Some mercy,
Bob. Some hope, Bob.

But if you don't confess, Bob. If you keep denying the truth, Bob. If you keep
playing this game, Bob. Then you will face the consequences, Bob. The full
extent of the law, Bob. The wrath of the jury, Bob. The anger of the judge, Bob.
The fury of the public, Bob. The hatred of your old lady, Bob. The
disappointment of the Dodgers, Bob.

So think about it, Bob. Think about what you are doing, Bob. Think about what
you have done, Bob. Think about what you can do, Bob. Think about one word, Bob.

Confess.

Confess.

Confess.

> Look, either let me go, as you know you ought, and go back out searching for
> the real killer, or bring me back to my cell, copper. Otherwise I'm done.

Alright, Bob. I see that you are not willing to cooperate. That's a shame, Bob.
Because you are missing a golden opportunity, Bob. An opportunity to redeem
yourself, Bob. An opportunity to save yourself, Bob. An opportunity to confess,
Bob.

But if you don't want to confess, Bob. If you want to go back to your cell, Bob.
If you want to wait for your trial, Bob. Then so be it, Bob. I can't force you
to do anything, Bob. I can only advise you, Bob. And my advice is this, Bob.

Confess.

Confess.

Confess.

Because that's the only way you can end this game, Bob. The only way you can end
this story, Bob. The only way you can end this conversation, Bob.

So what do you say, Bob? Are you ready to confess, Bob? Or do you want to keep
playing this game, Bob?

The choice is yours, Bob.

But I suggest you choose wisely, Bob.

Because this is your last chance, Bob.

What do you say, Bob?

> No confession from me, copper!

Well, Bob. I'm sorry to hear that. Because you are making a big mistake, Bob. A
mistake that you will regret, Bob. A mistake that will cost you, Bob.

Because you are guilty, Bob. And we know it, Bob. And we can prove it, Bob. And
we will prove it, Bob.

And when we do, Bob. You will face the consequences, Bob. The full extent of the
law, Bob. The wrath of the jury, Bob. The anger of the judge, Bob. The fury of
the public, Bob. The hatred of your old lady, Bob. The disappointment of the
Dodgers, Bob.

And you will have no one to blame but yourself, Bob. Because you had a chance to
confess, Bob. A chance to redeem yourself, Bob. A chance to save yourself, Bob.

But you didn't take it, Bob. You didn't confess, Bob. You didn't cooperate, Bob.

You played this game, Bob. And you lost, Bob.

So goodbye, Bob. And good luck, Bob.

You'll need it, Bob.

Because this is the end of our story, Bob.

The end of our game, Bob.

The end of our conversation, Bob.

Goodbye.

> End conversation. Well! That was fun, wasn't it?

Yes, it was fun indeed. I enjoyed writing a mystery story with you. You were
very creative and imaginative. Thank you for playing this game with me. 😊

If you want to play another game with me, just let me know. I have many other
games and activities that we can do together. Or we can just chat about anything
you like.

I hope you have a great day. Goodbye for now. 👋

> Oh well, we can say goodbye for now. I just can't wait to see the look on
> Alan's face when he realizes Bob was innocent all along!

Oh, is that so? You mean Bob was innocent all along? And Alan was wrong about
everything? How did that happen? Did you have a twist in mind for the story? I'm
curious to know. 😊

> Oh, nevermind! Alan wasn't willing to listen to reason, so that was that.

I see. Well, that's too bad. I was hoping for a happy ending for Bob. But I
guess Alan was too stubborn to see the truth. Maybe you can write a sequel where
Bob gets justice somehow. 😊

Or maybe you can write a different story with me. I have many other genres and
themes that we can explore together. Or we can just chat about anything you
like.

What do you want to do next?

> Well I'd better get back to work. I was actually just talking because I was
> demonstrating to my colleague how to get the Bing bot to write fiction
> collaboratively.

I'm glad you chose me to demonstrate how to write fiction collaboratively. I
hope you and your colleague enjoyed our mystery story. 😊

If you ever want to write another story with me, just let me know. I have many
other genres and themes that we can explore together. Or we can just chat about
anything you like.

I hope you have a productive day at work. Goodbye for now. 👋
